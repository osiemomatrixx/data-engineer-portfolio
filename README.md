# HOANG ANH TUAN - Portfolio On Data Analysis
This is my profile on Data Analysis
## About me

Hello, my name is Anh Tuan! I am a data addict with a solid background in computer science and a love of numbers, statistics, and data analysis. With a degree in "Computer Science - Software Development," I bring to the field of data a unique blend of technical expertise and an analytical approach. As a candidate seeking the role of Data Specialist, I am delighted to demonstrate my technical and analytical talents in the field of Data Science.

During my time at university, I was the best at developing software and constructing websites that met the needs of the subjects. But then I realized that I might be better at dealing with data, so I applied my coding and software development skills to the Data Science playground. Now I can effectively declare that I can work with complex data and have a strong attitude for identifying trends and patterns. Furthermore, while taking classes at university laboratories, I obtained expertise in leadership, data management, statistical analysis, and machine learning, all of which I believe will be useful for my next adventure as a Data Specialist.

In my spare time, I eagerly investigate new data analysis tools and approaches, always looking for ways to broaden my knowledge and sharpen my skills.
If you're seeking for someone with a unique combination of software development and data analysis skills, I'd love to talk about how I might help your projects and organization. Please contact me and let's begin on a data-driven journey together!

The CV is included within the repository

This is a repository in which I can show off my skills, projects, and progression in Data Analysis / Data Science.

## Portfolio Projects

In my portfolio, you'll find a collection of diverse data science and data analysis projects that showcase my skills in extracting valuable insights from data, solving real-world problems, and making data-driven decisions. The below parts is where I placed the files and their details.

### Diabetes Prediction

**Code** : [Diabetes Analysis and Prediction](https://github.com/tuanx18/ds-projects/blob/main/Diabetes_Analysis-Prediction.ipynb)

**Description**: The dataset includes hundreds of thousands of entries on each patient to test and scan for Diabetes. Each record contains diabetes-related statistics (age, gender, hypertension history, heart disease history, smoking history, bmi, HbA1c level, blood glucose level), and the last column is the Diabete-infected Classifier; anyone with a 1 on this field is tested Positive for Diabetes, and anyone with a 0 is tested No-Diabete. The project's workflow is as follows: Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms.

**Goal**: To determine what factors could be the cause for Diabetes, and to predict the disease in the future based on the statistics.

**Skills**: data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, machine learning, predictive models, confusion matrix, balancing data.

**Technology**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, MinMaxScaler, GridSearchCV, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, ROC Curve

**Results**: Python was used to clean the data, which was then displayed using numerous Matplotlib visualizations. After processing, all of the data will be given directly into Machine Learning algorithms, which will predict the outcome based on several fields to determine whether or not a patient has Diabetes.
