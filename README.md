# HOANG ANH TUAN - Portfolio On Data Analysis
This is my profile on Data Analysis
## About me

Hello, my name is Anh Tuan! I am a data addict with a solid background in computer science and a love of numbers, statistics, and data analysis. With a degree in "Computer Science - Software Development," I bring to the field of data a unique blend of technical expertise and an analytical approach. As a candidate seeking the role of Data Specialist, I am delighted to demonstrate my technical and analytical talents in the field of Data Science.

During my time at university, I was the best at developing software and constructing websites that met the needs of the subjects. But then I realized that I might be better at dealing with data, so I applied my coding and software development skills to the Data Science playground. Now I can effectively declare that I can work with complex data and have a strong attitude for identifying trends and patterns. Furthermore, while taking classes at university laboratories, I obtained expertise in leadership, data management, statistical analysis, and machine learning, all of which I believe will be useful for my next adventure as a Data Specialist.

In my spare time, I eagerly investigate new data analysis tools and approaches, always looking for ways to broaden my knowledge and sharpen my skills.
If you're seeking for someone with a unique combination of software development and data analysis skills, I'd love to talk about how I might help your projects and organization. Please contact me and let's begin on a data-driven journey together!

The CV is included within the repository

This is a repository in which I can show off my skills, projects, and progression in Data Analysis / Data Science.

## Portfolio Projects

In my portfolio, you'll find a collection of diverse data science and data analysis projects that showcase my skills in extracting valuable insights from data, solving real-world problems, and making data-driven decisions. The below parts is where I placed the files and their details

### Project 1

**Code** : Link

**Technology used**: ...

**Goal**: To determine what factors contribute the most to a movie's success.

**Description**: The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearson’s correlation statistical analysis.

**Skills**: data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology**: 

**Results**: Using Python to
