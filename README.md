This is my profile on Data Analysis
## About me

Hello, my name is Anh Tuan! I am a data addict with a solid background in computer science and a love of numbers, statistics, and data analysis. With a degree in "Computer Science - Software Development," I bring to the field of data a unique blend of technical expertise and an analytical approach. As a candidate seeking the role of Data Specialist, I am delighted to demonstrate my technical and analytical talents in the field of Data Science.

During my time at university, I was the best at developing software and constructing websites that met the needs of the subjects. But then I realized that I might be better at dealing with data, so I applied my coding and software development skills to the Data Science playground. Now I can effectively declare that I can work with complex data and have a strong attitude for identifying trends and patterns. Furthermore, while taking classes at university laboratories, I obtained expertise in leadership, data management, statistical analysis, and machine learning, all of which I believe will be useful for my next adventure as a Data Specialist.

In my spare time, I eagerly investigate new data analysis tools and approaches, always looking for ways to broaden my knowledge and sharpen my skills.
If you're seeking for someone with a unique combination of software development and data analysis skills, I'd love to talk about how I might help your projects and organization. Please contact me and let's begin on a data-driven journey together!
